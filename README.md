Plant Mating Systems Evolution Database
=======================================

This database and web-application were developed as a prototype for
the NESCent Working Group on "Understanding the paradox of mixed
mating in flowering plants" (PIs: Susan Kalisz, Mark Johnston).

Data
----

The database integrates four separate data collections.

1. The mating system database contains information on estimates of
   selfing/outcrossing rate and/or the inbreeding coefficient measured
   at the population level for 475 species.
2. The inbreeding depression database contains information on
   estimates inbreeding depression measured across the life history
   (3-stage or 4-stage IBD) measured at the population level.
3. The experimental pollination database contains information at the
   population level on experimental tests of selfing, outcrossing,
   pollen limitation, reproductive assurance, timing of selfing, etc.
4. The species traits database contains data on the average
   morphological, phenological, life history and habitat
   characteristics for all 475 species in the mating system database.

Significantly, all four databases contain citations to the original
publications from which the data were extracted.

This repository does not include the data. The data have been
deposited in the Dryad repository:
